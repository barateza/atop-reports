# Example Configuration File for atop-reports.sh
# Copy this file to /etc/atop-reports.conf to override default values
#
# This file is sourced by the script, so it must contain valid bash syntax.
# Only set the variables you want to override; unset variables will use
# the defaults defined in the script.

# Load Average Threshold: Trigger when load exceeds this value
# Recommended: Set to number of CPU cores (e.g., 4.0 for 4-core system)
#LOAD_THRESHOLD=4.0

# Memory Usage Threshold: Trigger when memory usage exceeds this percentage
# Recommended: 80 for production servers, 90 for development
#MEM_THRESHOLD=80

# I/O Wait Threshold: Trigger when CPU I/O wait exceeds this percentage
# Recommended: 25 means 25% of CPU time spent waiting for disk I/O
#IO_WAIT_THRESHOLD=25

# Check Interval: Seconds between metric checks when system is normal
#CHECK_INTERVAL=10

# Cooldown Period: Seconds to wait after an alert before next check
# This prevents alert spam during sustained high load
#COOLDOWN=300

# Log File: Path where alerts and reports will be written
#LOG_FILE="/var/log/atop-resource-alerts.log"

# Minimum Resource Threshold: Only show processes using more than this percentage
# of any single resource (CPU, Memory, or Disk)
#MIN_OFFENDER_THRESHOLD=10

# Example: Override for high-memory server (32GB+)
# MEM_THRESHOLD=90
# LOAD_THRESHOLD=8.0

# Example: Override for monitoring more frequently
# CHECK_INTERVAL=5
# COOLDOWN=180
